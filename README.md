Based on Phaser boilerplate in

https://github.com/LudoBermejo/PhaserJS-Webpack-Jasmine-Karma

## Features
- Tests with Jasmine. Yeah, tests!!
- I will add some specific lessons in different branches

# Setup
To use this bootstrap you’ll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/LudoBermejo/PhaserJS-Webpack-Jasmine-Karma```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```npm install```

## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

## 5. Run the tests:

Run:

```npm test```

This will run Karma and Jasmine basic tests

## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
